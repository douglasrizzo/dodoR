This package analyzes a response matrix under the 3-parameter logistic model of Item Response Theory (via the package [mirt](https://github.com/philchalmers.com/mirt)) and produces as output a collection of plots in PDF format regarding test information, item-parameter probability densities and item characteristic curves; information curves; standard error plots and distractor analysis under the nominal response model.
