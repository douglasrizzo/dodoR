<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Contains 50000 samples of the brazilian National High School Exam. This
dataset contains the 45 humanity sciences questions.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 50000 observations on the following 45 variables.
Rows represent examinees and columns represent items. Each question has a
possible answer of 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5, in numerical form.</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The Brazilian National High School Exam (Exame Nacional do Ensino Medio,
Enem) is a facultative summative educational evaluation available for every
Brazilian citizen that has finished, or is in the last year of high school.
The test allows students to enroll in higher degree educational courses.
</p>
<p>The exam is composed of 4 dichotomous tests: Humanities Sciences, Natural
Sciences, Languages and Codes and Mathematics. Each test is composed of 45
multiple-choice items. In the year 2012, the test was taken by
approximatelly 5.7 million examinees, whose data is freely available (see
Source section).
</p>
<p>For the creation of these R datasets, the original data, containing all 5.7
million observations, was downloaded from the Brazilian Ministry of
Education website. A sample of 50000 observations was then taken, composed
only of examinees who answered the full test. Note however, that
observations from one dataset available in this package does not directly
imply that the observations from the other datasets are indeed from the same
examinee, that is, the order of observations is randomized.
